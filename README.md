This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that displays **Discord Timestamps** (eg. `<t:1734818400:D>`) in **reading mode** the way they would display in Discord.

As long as this plugin is **enabled**, it converts those timestamps throughout the entire note when viewing it in **reading mode**. You can optionally disable converting timestamps in code blocks under **Settings → Discord Timestamps → Convert code blocks**.
## Appearance
Just like in Discord, the timestamp will have a **colored background** to it. If you **hover** over the timestamp (on desktop) or **select** the timestamp (on mobile), the full date and time will be displayed.
## Insert timestamp
There is also a **command** in the [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) as well as in the editor context menu to **insert a timestamp** when you are currently editing a note.

After you select a date and time in the modal that opens, it **generates timestamps** for you to use in multiple formats. After you select a format, it **inserts the timestamp** it into your note at your cursor’s location.
### Time zone support
Inserting timestamps supports specifying a **time zone** other than your local time zone for the timestamps to use.
- The chosen date and time will use the **selected time zone** when **generating timestamps**.
- **Reading mode** will still display all timestamps **in your local time**.
	- You can **manually specify** your local time zone under **Settings → Discord Timestamps → Local time zone**
### Timestamp history
When inserting a timestamp, there is an option to **reuse timestamps** from your **recent history** prior to selecting a format.
- The number of timestamps stored in your recent history can be adjusted under **Settings → Discord Timestamps → History size**.
